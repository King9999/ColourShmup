WHAT IS THIS GAME?

This is a significantly improved version of my old Flash game of the same name. The basic gameplay is the same; destroy enemies who are not your colour, and touch the ones who are the same colour to absorb their energy. Fill up your rainbow gauge to maximum, and unleash a beam to eliminate everything in your path!

Here's a list of changes from the original:

* Improved graphics thanks to the Pixel Spaceships asset pack (https://medimongames.itch.io/pixel-spaceships-hd)
* 100% more sound effects
* Enemies will now shoot at you. The frequency increases as you advance
* Enemy movement patterns added. More patterns unlock as you advance
* Gamepad support (CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY UNTIL UNITY RELEASES A PATCH FOR THE 2020 VERSION)
* Added graphical effects
* All enemies on screen are destroyed after completing a level, to give the player a breather

Overall, I'm very happy with how the game turned out, but the game also reminded me again how much work goes into creating even super small games. I wasn't even starting from scratch and the game still ended up being a lot of work!
